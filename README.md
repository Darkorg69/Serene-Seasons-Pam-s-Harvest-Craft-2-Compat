# Serene-Seasons-Pam-s-Harvest-Craft-2-Compat
Grow your crops in their respective seasons!

# What does this mod do?
***This mod adds a datapack which adds seasonal tags for all of the Pam's HarvestCraft 2 Crops***

# Why?
Because the latest available update of [Pam's HarvestCraft 2 - Crops](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pams-harvestcraft-2-crops "") , doesn't add seasonal tags to the crops, so using the mod alongside [Serene Seasons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/serene-seasons "") mod doesn't make crops grow in the respective seasons.

# Notice
**It's not recommended to install this mod unless you have both Serene Seasons and Pam's HarvestCraft 2 - Crops installed.**
